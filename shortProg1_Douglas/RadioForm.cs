 *          Description: The application purpose is to have the
 *          appearance of a radio, using the tools in the toolbox
 *          section and following the steps in the textbook, four
 *          group boxes were created. The first group box is called
 *          Pre-set Stations and has 6 buttons in it labeled 1 
 *          through 6 to simulate the presets a radio has. Group
 *          box 2 is labled Speakers and contains two check boxes
 *          labeled front and rear to simulate the control of 
 *          choosing which speakers to use. To the right of the
 *          second group box is a text box with Power On/Off to 
 *          simulate a power button. Group box 3 is at the bottom
 *          left and is labeled Volume Control and contains a Mute
 *          check box to simulate the mute functin and a track bar 
 *          to simulate the control of the volume for the radio app.
 *          Group box 4 is labeled Tuning and contains a label with
 *          a black background with silver text saying 92.9 and 2 
 *          radio buttons labeled AM and FM to simulate the frequency
